\section{Learning Methods for Simultaneously Potential Maximizing Equilibria}

As far as we are aware, log-linear learning (LLL) is the only known learning algorithm that converges to potential maximizing behavior in potential games. So, it offers a promising way to learn simultaneously potential maximizing behavior in SPGs. However, as we saw in Chapter 3, our naive extension of LLL to stochastic games does necessarily converge to Nash equilibrium, let alone simultaneously potential maximizing equilibrium. So, it remains an open question to describe learning dynamics that converge to simultaneously potential maximizing equilibria in SPGs.
